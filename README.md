# Alien Banjo Attackers From Space

ABAFS is an arcade style space invaders-esque game where alien banjos are invading Earth and you must stop them by piloting an accordian ship.

Using either A or D or the Left and Right arrow keys you can pilot your accordian ship and shoot musical note bullets using the space bar. 

There are an infinite amount of levels and the difficulty for each level keeps scaling (The number of enemies as well as their movement speed similar to space invaders). To complete a level you must kill all enemy banjos on screen. There are three types of banjos which behave differently (more info in user manual).

The game has a leaderboard system which stores the top 3 scores of all time and displays them on the game over screen. It also has a display on the main menu reminiscent of classic arcade machines. The game also allows you to save your progress and come back later.
